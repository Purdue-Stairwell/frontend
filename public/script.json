		"Welcome to StairWELL, an interactive sculpture and gathering place.",
		"What makes it interactive is that YOU create the art. We know you’re busy. But this is easy– just take a moment for yourself. …draw a “squiggle” to capture how you’re feeling today.",
		"",
		"That moment you just had–that was reflection! Thinking about how you’re feeling is important",
		"Sometimes we’re feeling up… Sometimes we’re feeling down… Sometimes we’re feeling something else… or somewhere in between",
		"Ok, we’ll come back to that squiggle in just a second",
		"But now, let’s zoom out a bit. Think about how you’ve been feeling the last two weeks as you answer these five quick questions.",
		"Over the last two weeks: I have felt cheerful and in good spirits",
		"Over the last two weeks: I have felt calm and relaxed",
		"Over the last two weeks: I have felt active and vigorous",
		"Over the last two weeks: I woke up feeling fresh and rested",
		"Over the last two weeks: My daily life has been filled with things that interest me",
		"So maybe you’ve felt some of those ups, downs, or in-betweens. Reflection isn’t always easy–it takes honesty and bravery–but it’s a healthy thing to do. The squiggles on StairWELL celebrate each person who has taken time to reflect–just like you.",
		"Let's get back to that squiggle... wanna refresh it now that you've checked in with yourself?",
		"Look at XX where your squiggle will appear”",
		"Thanks for your moment of reflection–it’s a powerful tool you can always use. …And, today, you’ve added beauty to StairWELL!",
		"We appreciate you!",
		"Purdue has an amazing collection of people and services to help you thrive. Check out this portal…",
		"StairWELL was Built at Purdue by a team of students, faculty & staff. Here’s the creative team (list) and project partners (list)"
